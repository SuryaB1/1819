If you're not familiar, GitHub is a version control tool used for collaborative programming projects.
To verify that you can make additions to the team code, clone the 1819 repository to your computer, type your name below, and add this change to the repository by making a commit to the master branch.
Use an IDE that supports GitHub or download the GitHub Desktop app (https://desktop.github.com/) to do this.
